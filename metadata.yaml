summary: '"Kurjet" by Maila Talvio is a novel written in the early 20th century. The
  book explores themes of family, shame, and societal expectations through the lens
  of the Tuuna family, particularly focusing on the protagonist, Riikka Tuuna. As
  the narrative unfolds, we delve into the emotional turmoil and conflicts within
  the Tuuna household as they grapple with a sense of disgrace tied to their neighbor’s
  actions.  The opening of "Kurjet" introduces Riikka Tuuna as she lays awake in her
  bed, enveloped in a profound sense of shame and unrest. The narrative paints a picture
  of a cold February night, where Riikka reflects on the changes in her life and the
  lives of her family members due to a recent scandal involving her brother and their
  neighbor’s wife, Sylvi. As she anxiously awaits her brother Toivo''s return, the
  tension mounts, revealing her internal struggles, memories of her past, and anxieties
  about the present situation. The atmosphere is charged with a mix of nostalgia and
  foreboding, hinting at the conflicts that will unravel in the relationships governed
  by family loyalty and societal judgment. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
